# Overview

Creates a database of quotes in the cloud. It stores both spiritual and motivational quotes and allows you to add, edit type of quote and status. 

I have always wanted to build a cloud based quote capture system.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add View All Quotes, View Spiritual Quotes and View Motivational Quotes to the main selection level.
* Create a Keyword search as the search query
* I would love to make the search usable. so it would list all the quotes and could select the number a quote was assigned and have it pull up so that minor changes can be made while looking at the quote.
